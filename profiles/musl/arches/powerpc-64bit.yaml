    NOTE: It may be possible to drop ``-mlong-double-64`` from cflags, above. This needs testing.
    
    There are challenges related to building PowerPC, and PowerPC and MUSL specifically. Musl requires
    ELFv2 and also requires a "long double" of 64-bit to be the default in the compiler toolchain. This
    in turn requires a few extra configure flag toggles for gcc. The most helpful resource I found for
    determining the correct flags are in the APKBUILD for gcc in Adelie Linux. Although this is for gcc
    8.x, it seems to still work well for 11.x that we are using::

    Here are some other related links that I used in my research of this issue, which could provide
    additional context on the various challenges (these should be roughly in the order of usefulness,
    with the most useful at the top):
