    I may be misinterpreting the MUSL information incorrectly, but in additional to enabling ELFv2 in gcc,
    it look like we need 64-bit long doubles:

      https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=93157
      https://wiki.musl-libc.org/supported-platforms.html

    So I found this, and am using the --with-libf7=no option with gcc for PowerPC to see if this induces
    the correct result:

    Please note my hacks on PowerPC 64-bit need additional testing and could be totally wrong at this point.
